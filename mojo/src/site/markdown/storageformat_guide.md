## Usage

From Confluence 4.0 has been introduced the [XHTML-based storage format](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html).

To use such format is pretty streighforward it is enough to specify a **.xhtml** file in the **site's uri**.

> **Note:** Version constraints
>
> The Storage Format is supported starting from version **5.0-beta1** and it is available only for **Confluence version 5.5 or above**
